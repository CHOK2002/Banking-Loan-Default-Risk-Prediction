# Banking-Loan-Default-Risk-Prediction

## Background
This project examines loan default prediction models to overcome the limitations of conventional banking systems by improving credit risk management through accurate predictions. While some models in this project have failed to significantly enhance the credit evaluation process, tree-based models have surprisingly demonstrated the ability to better assess borrowers' repayment capacities and support more informed lending decisions. The banking loan datasets used in this project are sourced from **Analytics Vidhya's Machine Learning Summer Training Hackathon**, where participants aim to achieve the highest possible accuracy using the provided training dataset.
